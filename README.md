Overview
---

A Data Visualization Project utilizing GPS data. Demo utilizes D3.js to create interactive maps on top of [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/).

Setup:
----

Run a local Apache server. For Mac OSX users, I recommend using the MAMP app. 
Load index.html for your local server. In the case of MAMP, open localhost:888

For converting Google Location Data's .kml file into a usable JSON object, thanks to stsvilik's [Xml-to-JSON converter](https://github.com/stsvilik/Xml-to-JSON).

Thanks to Chris Zetter and his [guide using D3 with Leaflet](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/). His blog post provided the initial code and instructions for mapping on top of Leaflet.

For the original demo of utilizing D3.js on top of Leaflet, we followed Chris Zetter's [Voronoi maps](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/14/visualising-supermarkets-with-a-voronoi-diagram/) guide. You can find the [original project here](https://github.com/zetter/voronoi-maps).
