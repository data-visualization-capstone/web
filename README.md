This repo contains a fork from Chris Zetter's [Voronoi maps](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/14/visualising-supermarkets-with-a-voronoi-diagram/) project - using D3 and Leaflet. You can find the [original project here](https://github.com/zetter/voronoi-maps).


#### Setup:

Run a local Apache server. For Mac OSX users, I recommend using the MAMP app. 
Load index.html for your local server. In the case of MAMP, open localhost:888
