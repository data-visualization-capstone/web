		<p>According to "Ameica's Rental Housing-Evolving Markets and Needs" by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the percentage of American households renting is on the rise, increasing sharply across most age groups between 2004 and 2013. Furthermore, families with children are nearly as likely to rent their homes as single persons. Renters have a multitude of concerns, but just knowing where to look can be a daunting task. Realtors have a vested interest in maintaining information asymmetry and don't' make their listings available to their clients, making it hard to know what neighborhoods or cities are in your price range. Renters are also concerned with historical trends in rental prices and would benefit from predictions about future prices. We evaluated several attempts to visualize Boston rent prices on the internet, including a tool by a Boston start up , Jumpshell, and a map made by Jeff Kaufman, a Google employee located in Cambridge. We present a website that uses the data Kaufman gathered from Craigslist listings to map several years of Boston rent prices, while also being able to query social media activity in the Boston area. Our hope is that users will find it to be a useful exploratory tool for learning about the Boston rental market. The code for the website is made available under the MIT license so as to allow it to be repurposed for other cities.</p>
