			<p>This Living Cities case study contextualizes Bostonâ€™s average rent prices with other relevant information. This additional context includes Boston neighborhood borders, MBTA lines, and social media posts within the city. By combining this information in a single tool, we seek to facilitate a greater understanding of where the viewer might want to live in Boston.</p>
			<p><b>Our goal was to provide a tool that users could use to explore and compare a variety of different data sources.</b></p>
